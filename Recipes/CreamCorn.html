    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Corn: This recipe starts with two packages of thawed frozen corn kernels.</li>
            <li>Cream: Heavy whipping cream is the key to the creamy, decadent texture.</li>
            <li>Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar adds a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: This creamed corn recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>Butter: Butter adds richness and flavor.</li>
            <li>Milk: This recipe calls for whole milk, but you can use 2 percent milk if you'd prefer.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour acts as a thickening agent, so you don't have to worry about runniness.</li>
            <li>Cheese: Parmesan cheese is the perfect finishing touch. For more cheesy flavor, sprinkle some more on top before serving.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine corn, heavy cream, sugar, butter, salt, and pepper in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until butter has melted, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
